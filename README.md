# ChiefStaker

A Solana program for staking Token 2022 tokens with time-weighted SOL reward distribution. Permissionless pool creation with creator-configurable settings.

## How It Works

Staking weight grows over time using an exponential curve:

```
weight = stake_amount * (1 - e^(-age / tau))
```

- New stakers start near **0% weight**
- Weight asymptotically approaches **100%** over time
- At 1 tau: ~63% weight
- At 3 tau: ~95% weight
- At 5 tau: ~99% weight

This prevents flash-stake attacks -- you can't just deposit right before a reward distribution and steal rewards from long-term stakers.

SOL rewards are distributed proportionally based on each staker's current weight. Rewards can be deposited directly via instruction or sent to the pool PDA (e.g., from pump.fun fee revenue) and synced.

## Features

- **Permissionless pool creation** -- anyone can create a staking pool for any Token 2022 mint
- **Time-weighted rewards** -- configurable tau (time constant) per pool
- **Creator-configurable settings** -- minimum stake amounts, lock durations, unstake cooldown periods
- **Authority management** -- transfer or renounce pool authority
- **Cooldown unstake flow** -- optional request/wait/complete unstake for pools that want it
- **O(1) operations** -- all instructions run in constant time regardless of staker count
- **Sybil resistant** -- splitting stake across accounts gives no advantage
- **Direct SOL rewards** -- SOL sent directly to the pool PDA is auto-detected via `SyncRewards`

## Instructions

| # | Instruction | Description |
|---|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | `InitializePool` | Create a new staking pool for a Token 2022 mint |
| 1 | `Stake` | Stake tokens into the pool |
| 2 | `Unstake` | Unstake tokens (direct, when no cooldown) |
| 3 | `ClaimRewards` | Claim accumulated SOL rewards |
| 4 | `DepositRewards` | Deposit SOL rewards into the pool |
| 5 | `SyncPool` | Rebase pool math to prevent overflow |
| 6 | `SyncRewards` | Sync SOL sent directly to the pool PDA |
| 7 | `UpdatePoolSettings` | Set min stake, lock duration, cooldown (authority only) |
| 8 | `TransferAuthority` | Transfer or renounce pool authority |
| 9 | `RequestUnstake` | Start unstake cooldown (tokens keep earning) |
| 10 | `CompleteUnstake` | Finish unstake after cooldown elapsed |
| 11 | `CancelUnstakeRequest` | Cancel a pending unstake request |

## Pool Settings

Pool creators can configure these settings at any time (until authority is renounced):

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `min_stake_amount` | 0 (none) | Minimum tokens required to stake |
| `lock_duration_seconds` | 0 (none) | Time staker must wait after last deposit before unstaking |
| `unstake_cooldown_seconds` | 0 (none) | Required cooldown period via request/complete flow |

The tau value (`tau_seconds`) is set at pool creation and is **immutable**.
