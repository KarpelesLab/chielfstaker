//! Recover stranded rewards instruction
//!
//! When users did additional stakes (before the round-7 fix), immature rewards
//! became permanently stranded — tracked in `last_synced_lamports` but not owed
//! to any staker.  This permissionless instruction computes the exact stranded
//! amount on-chain using only pool state (`total_reward_debt`), then marks the
//! excess as undistributed so the next `sync_rewards` redistributes it.
